# AI-Powered ERP Job Verification System

## Overview
This project integrates an AI-powered verification service into Microsoft Dynamics 365 to streamline the second-checking process for jobs. The goal is to automatically validate that uploaded document attachments (sales quotes, invoices, delivery proofs, etc.) match the job details, reduce manual labor, and ensure high accuracy in job processing.

  - Provides actionable reports and clear job status updates.

- **Creativity:**  
  - Innovative AI insights that not only flag discrepancies but explain them.
  - Incorporates interactive, engaging elements in the reporting dashboard.
  - Unique features such as smart learning from user feedback and possibly a chatbot assistant.

- **Wow Factor:**  
  - Real-time processing with immediate visual feedback.
  - Sleek, modern UI with animations, theme customization, and dynamic charts.
  - Smart automation that impressively reduces manual intervention.

- **Execution:**  
  - High-quality UI with a pixel-perfect design, intuitive navigation, and mobile responsiveness.
  - Robust backend with fast API responses, efficient AI processing, and secure data handling.
  - Well-integrated solution with clear, actionable insights for end-users.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (User Interface)
- **Functionality:**
  - Dashboard to view jobs, verification statuses, and detailed flagged reports.
  - Real-time updates (via WebSockets or long polling) so users receive immediate feedback.
  - Notifications for flagged discrepancies.
- **Tech Stack Options:**
  - Frameworks: React.js or Next.js.
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material UI.
  - Additional: Power Apps / Power BI if integrating closely with Microsoft ecosystem.
- **Key Elements:**
  - Loading indicators during processing.
  - Interactive charts and filters for exploring flagged jobs.
  - Clear notifications and feedback options for users.

### Backend (AI Processing & ERP Integration)
- **Functionality:**
  - Retrieve job details and attachments from Microsoft Dynamics 365 (API access will be provided).
  - Process documents in near real-time using AI (OCR & NLP) to verify that document content matches job details.
  - Update job statuses in Dynamics 365 (e.g., mark as "Second Checked" or flag for review).
  - Trigger notifications (email/SMS) to job owners for discrepancies.
- **Tech Stack Options:**
  - Languages/Frameworks: Python (FastAPI/Flask) or Node.js (Express).
  - AI Tools: Azure Form Recognizer (OCR), SpaCy/OpenAI GPT (NLP).
  - Data Storage: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for logs and flagged jobs.
  - Cloud Integration: Azure Functions for automation if needed.
- **Key Elements:**
  - Asynchronous processing for fast results.
  - Robust error handling, logging, and scalability.
  - Secure and reliable API endpoints for Dynamics 365 integration.

## Workflow Details

### Immediate User Results
1. **Job Submission:**  
   - The ERP sends job details and document attachments to the AI verification API as soon as a job is submitted.
2. **Real-Time Processing:**  
   - The AI processes the job using OCR and NLP, with asynchronous operations ensuring minimal delay.
3. **Feedback to User:**  
   - The UI shows a loading indicator during processing.
   - Once completed, the system displays results:
     - **Verified:** Job marked as “Second Checked” with detailed matching report.
     - **Flagged:** Discrepancies are highlighted (e.g., mismatched quantities, missing signatures) and notifications are sent immediately.
4. **Dashboard Updates:**  
   - The frontend dashboard is updated in real-time to reflect job statuses and detailed reports.

### Learning from User Feedback
1. **Feedback Collection:**  
   - Users can rate the verification accuracy and provide comments directly on the dashboard.
   - Feedback forms after reviewing flagged jobs allow users to confirm or dispute the AI’s findings.
2. **Data Logging & Analysis:**  
   - All user feedback, along with job details and AI outputs, are logged into a central database.
   - An analytics dashboard helps identify trends and recurring issues.
3. **Model Retraining:**  
   - Feedback data is used to retrain and fine-tune the OCR and NLP models periodically.
   - Rule-based adjustments are applied to thresholds for detecting discrepancies.
4. **Continuous Improvement:**  
   - The system evolves over time, learning from feedback to reduce false positives and improve verification accuracy.
